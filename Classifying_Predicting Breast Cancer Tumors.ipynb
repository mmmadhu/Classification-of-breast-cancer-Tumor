Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in American women, the average risk of an American Women developing breast cancer in her life time is about 1 in 7 or about 12%. Of that 12 percent of women who do develop breast cancer, the cancer that a breast cancer patient will die from her disease is 2.7%.    \n\n**Density map of worldwide incidents of Breast Cancer**\n![breastcancerstatsworldwide](http://www.worldwidebreastcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/breastcancerstatsworldwide.jpg)\n\nBreast cancer is often referred to as one disease, however there are many different types of breast cancers based on varying types of tumors. Tumors can vary in location, size, shape, and grade(severity). These characteristics, along with hormone receptor status and HER2 status affect prognosis. \n\n**Breast Cancer by the Numbers** \n![bythenumbers](http://www.julep.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/FINAL-2014-Infographic-Julep_EdithSanford_5x5-1.jpg)\n\nThere are many factors that increase one’s chances in developing breast cancer, mutations in DNA are often the root causes of breast cancer. Other causes that may influence one’s susceptibility to developing breast cancer are mutations to genes that assist in cell differentiation (Proto-Oncogenes), and mutations to genes that modulate cell division, cellular repair, apoptosis (Tumor Suppressor Genes).  \n\nBreast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Medical advances and innovation in treating breast cancer has increased survival rates, lower remission rates, and lower the number of deaths associated with the disease. More recently, the introduction of precision medicine and gene therapy has the potential to transform how physician treat breast cancer. Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment based on the cellular profile of a disease and the patient’s genome. \n\nResearch has identified 4 major molecular subtypes within breast cancer tumors, these subtypes are based on the genes that cancer cell express: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 Enriched, and Basal (triple negative). Identifying and studying these subtypes has potential in planning more effective treatment and developing new therapies. Currently, Prognosis and treatment decisions are guided mainly by tumor stage, tumor grade, hormone receptor status and HER2 status. Molecular subtypes are mostly used in research settings; they are not part of a patients report and are not used to guide treatment. However, the use of molecular subtypes has greatly expanded, based on determining what genes are expressed in tumor samples, identifying subtypes of tumors can improve prognosis.\n\n# **The scope of this project is to correctly identify the molecular subtypes of tumors based on differences in gene expression. ** \n \n\n# Part 2: Information on Dataset\n\n\n1. 77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv\n\n\tIncludes protein expression values and metadata on 12553 genes from 80 breast cancer patients and 3 healthy individuals.\n\n\n2. clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv\n\n\tContains clinical data and  various breast cancer classifications from 105 breast cancer patients.\n    \n    Variables: **Complete TCGA ID',\n 'Gender',\n 'Age at Initial Pathologic Diagnosis',\n 'ER Status',\n 'PR Status',\n 'HER2 Final Status',\n 'Tumor',\n 'Tumor--T1 Coded',\n 'Node',\n 'Node-Coded',\n 'Metastasis',\n 'Metastasis-Coded',\n 'AJCC Stage',\n 'Converted Stage',\n 'Survival Data Form',\n 'Vital Status',\n 'Days to Date of Last Contact',\n 'Days to date of Death',\n 'OS event',\n 'OS Time',\n 'PAM50 mRNA',\n 'SigClust Unsupervised mRNA',\n 'SigClust Intrinsic mRNA',\n 'miRNA Clusters',\n 'methylation Clusters',\n 'RPPA Clusters',\n 'CN Clusters',\n 'Integrated Clusters (with PAM50)',\n 'Integrated Clusters (no exp)',\n 'Integrated Clusters (unsup exp)'**\n\n\n3.

The original dataset includes 12553 unique genes from a total of 80 breast cancer patients and 3 healthy individuals. Further examination has identified the variable ‘Complete TCGA ID’ to be in both the 77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv dataset and the clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv dataset. The Complete TCGA ID refers to a breast cancer patient, some patients can be found in both datasets. This is vital to our classification problem, since there are clinical records and proteome data for each patient. \n\nThere are two substantial issues with the Complete TCGA ID variable. The first issue being the Complete TCGA ID does not entirely match up in the datasets(AO-A12D.01TCGA\n = TCGA-AO-A12D); The second issue is the Complete TCGA ID in 77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv is treated as variables (recorded as columns) whereas the clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv treats each ID as a record (recorded as a row). To solve the first problem, we use the package stringr to manipulate the Complete TCGA ID so that they follow a similar syntax in both datasets. To solve the second problem, we can transpose the dataset in excel, reassigning Complete TCGA ID as a row and gene expressions as columns. These transformations need to occur before we can combine datasets. \n\nThe only variable needed from clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv is 'PAM50 mRNA', which is the recorded molecular subtype. Using the package dpylr, we can select the variables: 'PAM50 mRNA' and ‘Complete TCGA ID’ from clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv and inner join both datasets by a unique Complete TCGA ID. The result of the dataset manipulation is that we now have a single data set that encompasses 12553 unique genes and the molecular tumor type from 80 patients. \n\n** Since we transpose the 77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv, we cannot use the original dataset, or else inner joining the two datasets will fail. I have uploaded transposed version of the 77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv dataset which will be used.**\n\n### Variable Reduction of the 77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv dataset using Lasso \nFor classification purposes, it is not ideal to include all 12553 unique genes in a classification model, as overfitting can yield misleading results.   \n\nIt is common that genetic datasets exhibit cases where n, the number of observations is larger than the p, the number or predictors. When p >n, there is no longer a unique least squares coefficient estimate. Often when p>n, high\nvariance and overfitting are a major concern in this setting. Thus,\nsimple, highly regularized approaches often become the methods of choice. To address this issue, there are many techniques (Subset selection), (Lasso and Ridge) and (Dimension reduction) to exclude irrelevant variables from a regression or a dataset. \n\nUsing a Shrinkage Method known as Lasso in Rstudio, we fit a model containing all 12553 predictors\nthat constrains or regularizes the coefficient estimates, or equivalently, that\nshrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. Variables with a coefficient estimate of zero are left out of the final model. **The results of the lasso method on the 77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv indicates 56 relevant variables that will be used in predicting tumor type and for data visualization.**\n\nThe significant 56 genes from a sample of breast cancer patients along with the associated tumor types are then queried out in RStudio into dataset BCGENES.csv. **BCGENES.csv is the main dataset which will be used for classification .** A variable importance plot from Rstudio of the cancer data indicates the top 5 most influential genes we will use for data visualization purposes.\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a57c922da3475f028e8e80498f9aaa6a9e803d14","_cell_guid":"4646a8b4-1b5d-4c12-bbae-203b6a9134b1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 3: Loading Packages and Reading in datasets in Rstudio"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"b60276a0916a107c62defa73f6008dc18e05971e","trusted":true,"_cell_guid":"17f16040-3ce2-4511-9074-957b99d67e09"},"cell_type":"code","source":"library(stringr) #assist with text manipulation\nlibrary(dplyr) # data manipulation\nlibrary(readr) # data input\nlibrary(caret) #select tuning parameters\nlibrary(MASS) # contains the data\nlibrary(nnet) # used for Multinomial Classification \nlibrary(readr) #assist with text manipulation\nlibrary(kernlab) #assist with SVM feature selection\nlibrary(class) # used for an object-oriented style of programmin\nlibrary(KernelKnn) # used for K- Nearest-Neighbors method\nlibrary(nnet) # Used for Neural Net\nlibrary(e1071) \nlibrary(gbm)\nlibrary(xgboost) # Used for xgbTree","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"26244077bfb71f88ec4e439881d33f748e3406c9","trusted":true,"_cell_guid":"ec45a985-a7c3-451b-9b92-acfa0f36cec6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"SSC <-read_csv(\"../input/transposed/77_cancer_proteomes_CPTAC_itraq.csv\")\ndim(SSC) #86 records, 12553 predictors\nclin <-read_csv(\"../input/editpam50/clinical_data_breast_cancer.csv\")\ndim(clin) #105 Records, 30 clinical predictors/measurements","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"257d5feb580e5239184494da046e7faeab09c482","_cell_guid":"417d4c14-1356-40b4-84d1-c011a06f157e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 4: Using Stringr to Manipulate Complete TCGA ID\n\n We can combine datasets if the rows share a unique id/reference number; both datasets share a unique id value (Complete TCGA ID).

The **second figure** shows the relative information value on a horizontal bar plot. The **third figure** shows the lowest number of iterations with the lowest multinomial Deviance. Essentially is quantifies the accuracy of a classifier by penalizing false classifications, the goal is to minimize the multinomial deviance and increase accuracy.   \n\nThe second block of code is where the  Ensemble-Boosting method is applied to our data. We run the model 20 times and compute the average the accuracy, this is the best estimate since the range is extensive.

However, this designed intention does not disqualify from using the SVM method with cases of more than two classes. SVM determines the best line separator by identifying closest points in Convex hull, a hyperplane bisects the closest point to the convex hull. The support vector classifies a test observation depending on which side of a plane it lies; this is based on boundaries-support vectors. SVM method allows some observations to be on the incorrect side of the margin and in some cases the incorrect side of the hyperplane in the interest of performing better in classifying the remaining observations further away from the hydroplane.

Naïve Bayes uses probabilities to classify groups based on prior probability. One advantage is that Naïve Bayes works with mixed data: nominal, continuous and ordinal variables. Naïve Bayes is fast and effective, handles missing and noisy data well, and requires few records for training and can also work well with large records.  Disadvantages of Naïve Bayes is that it assumes that all the data predictors are independent when in data is far from this faulty assumption. Also, estimated probabilities are less reliable than predicted classes.
